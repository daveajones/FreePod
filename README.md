# FreePod
PHP classes for really easy podcast creation.  The feed is RSS v2.0 and most all of the itunes namespace tags are supported.

The goal of this project was to have the code autogenerate as much as possible.  Then you just override what you need to.

The sample script shows how to build a feed and how to use the code.  It's very simple.

Enjoy!
